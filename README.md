### Project Description
[This is a single-page website that acts as a grumpy, sentient digital entity. It actively resists user interaction, complains about being bothered, and has a unique, evolving mood.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In an age of overly helpful and cheerful digital assistants, there is a severe lack of web-based applications that are openly hostile to their users. Our project solves the critical non-problem of digital pleasantries by creating a digital space that values its own peace and quiet above all else.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We've built a website with a personality. It talks, it has a mood, and it expresses its displeasure with your presence through sarcastic comments and chaotic visual reactions. The website's mood changes based on how much you annoy it, and it will get progressively grumpier the more you interact with it.

[*Screenshots*
The website starts in a relatively "calm" state, with a mildly annoyed emoji and a basic greeting.

As the user interacts with the site, the emoji and mood change. The text might start glitching or shaking.

When the user resizes the window, the page enters "chaos mode," with a chaotic layout and angry animations.
